## Description

Backend task implemented using nest js

## Tools & Technologies
- [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
- Nodejs
- Javascript/Typescript
- Postgres
- docker
- jest



## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

## Running the app
- Create .env file and set environment variables. Please check .env.example file for reference. For db name, you can check [docker-compose](https://github.com/Irfanbsse2060/e-commerce/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file as well.


```bash
# spin up db using docker
$ npm run db:dev:up


# development
$ npm run start

# Seed data into db
$ npm run seed

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

For testing, I prefer to follow testing pyramid, more unit tests and less e2e tests.
In unit testings, I have tried to covered most of the cases in services. The project has e2e setup as well.
So we can easily add it and to cover it.


```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.


# Task description
## APIs To Implement

Below is a list of the required API's for the application.

1. **_GET_** `/contracts/:id` - This API is broken ðŸ˜µ! it should return the contract only if it belongs to the profile calling. better fix that!

1. **_GET_** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only contain non terminated contracts.

1. **_GET_** `/jobs/unpaid` - Get all unpaid jobs for a user (**_either_** a client or contractor), for **_active contracts only_**.

1. **_POST_** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

1. **_POST_** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

1. **_GET_** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.

1. **_GET_** `/admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer>` - returns the clients the paid the most for jobs in the query time period. limit query parameter should be applied, default limit is 2.

```
 [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "fullName": "Reece Moyer",
        "paid" : 100.3
    },
    {
        "id": 200,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 99
    },
    {
        "id": 22,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 21
    }
]
```

## Going Above and Beyond the Requirements

Given the time expectations of this exercise, we don't expect anyone to submit anything super fancy, but if you find yourself with extra time, any extra credit item(s) that showcase your unique strengths would be awesome! ðŸ™Œ

It would be great for example if you'd write some unit test / simple frontend demostrating calls to your fresh APIs.
